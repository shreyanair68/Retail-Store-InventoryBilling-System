# Retail-Store-InventoryBilling-System

Our project was to design an inventory and a billing system for a chain store-retail or otherwise. We decided to design such a system for a medical store.
The main objective of the project was to design a system that could have an inventory such that if a customer tries to order a product which is not present in the store or is currently unavailable, then he or she would get an alert that conveys the message that the item is unavailable. If the product is available, then the customer should be able to place an order.
